# CS410 MP2---Search Engines

In this 4-part MP, you will get familiar with building and evaluating Search Engines.

All MPs are checked on [EWS machines](https://answers.uillinois.edu/illinois.engineering/page.php?id=81727).
While we cannot ensure that all operating systems and configurations are covered in the instructions, students can connect to these Linux-based workstations to complete assignments.

## Part 3

### Due: Oct 7, 2019 at 11:59 pm

In Part 3 of MP2, you will help build a test collection based on the Cranfield Evaluation Methodology covered in class.


We've compiled all the faculty bio submissions from MP2 Part1 that were submitted by Oct 4. 
Ignoring duplicate urls, very short bios (<5 words), and some files with formatting issues, there were a total of ~`[coming soon]` faculty bios!
We will be using this compiled dataset as the document collection for this exercise.
Feel free to browse through the dataset if you like: `[zip file coming soon]`


Your task is to submit relevance judgements for at least one query of your choice related to the document collection.

Please use this sign-up sheet `[link coming soon]` to enter your queries. Max ~10 students may use the same query.
Please follow the instructions in the file `Annotation_Instructions.pdf` carefully for submission.
No other submissions on Gitlab or Coursera are required.


Good Luck!
