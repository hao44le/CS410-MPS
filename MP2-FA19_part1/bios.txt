A. Gustafson Teaching Award, Fall 1997, Fall 2014 Research Areas Current research interests involve the study of transitional and turbulent fluid flows using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) as an investigative tool. Most flows of engineering interest are turbulent and turbulence has a significant impact on the performance of engineering systems. The drag on a body is generally much greater if the boundary layer is turbulent. Turbulence also increases heat transfer between a fluid and a surface. In addition, turbulent mixing is important to combustion. The physics of basic turbulent flows are studied using direct numerical simulations (DNS) and large-eddy simulations (LES). With LES the motion of the largest eddies are solved for directly while the effects of the unresolved small scale eddies are modeled. In contrast, with DNS all the relevant length scales within the turbulence are resolved and no modeling is needed. The results of the simulations are used to increase our understanding of turbulence and to test and improve turbulence models. Parallel computing and advanced numerical methods is another area of interest. Publications N. S. Dhamankar, G. A. Blaisdell, and A. S.

This program clusters feature vectors to produce a Gaussian mixture model. It also estimates the number of clusters directly from the data. Tomography software This directory contains two software packages for model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) tomography. It includes code for STEM/TEM recon of bright and darkfield data, and 3-D/4-D synchrotron recon code. It also contains some old lagancy code packages. SLADS A python implementation of an algorithm for dynamic 2D sampling. This algorithm can be used in applications such as microscopy to select the most informative next pixel location based on previous measurements. Plug-and-Play Priors for Interpolation and Reconstruction This links to software packages for easy-to-use Plug-and-Play implementations. Simple examples with data are giving for sparse interpolation and tomographic reconstruction. Multi-UAV Target Tracking Datasets This links to a ground-truthed dataset that contains HD video of multiple fixed-winged GPUs. The data was given to us courtesy of Tim Chung, Mathias Kolsch, and Oleg Yakimenko of the Navel Postgraduate School, and then it was manually ground-truthed by Jin Li and Dong Hye Ye using the VATIC package. SMAP segmentation software Robust and computationally efficient software for segmenting images using a Bayesian multiscale framework. It uses the Cluster software above as a basis for characterizing the region classes. The package includes TEST IMAGES from associated publications. Sparse Matrix Transform (SMT) code and publications The SMT is a generalization of the FFT and orthonormal wavelet transform that can be used for covariance estimation and fast matrix-vector product computation. It is particularly well suited for non-stationary random processes and time(space)-varying systems analysis. Color Quantization Software This directory contains a software packages for performing color quantization of color images using the binary splitting method. Document Descreening Color document descreening softwared known as Resolution Synthesis based Descreening as described in the IEEE TIP March 2007 paper. Document Text Segmentation for MRC Coding This software uses a combination of block-based segmentation known as cost-optimized segmentation (COS) and MRF based classification known as connected-components classification (CCC) to detect and segment text from raster document images. YCxCz Fidelity Metrics Software This is a Matlab package for computing two fidelity metrics based on the YCxCz color transformation. One quality metric is based on a non-linear transformation to an Lab-like space, and the other transform is based on a linearized Lab space. Both metrics incoporate a modulation transfer function for the human visual system. Clustered Component Analysis (CCA) An Algorithm for Estimating Component Directions in Data. This matlab coding is designed to automatically estimate the number and directions of distinct non-orthogonal components in multivariate data. It can be used in a manner similar to independent components analysis (ICA), but it is based on an explict signal and noise model, and it performs maximum likihood (ML) parameter estimation using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Its algorithmic structure is similar to that used in the Cluster algorithm above. RegressionTree Tree-Structured Predictor Program C source code that implements an algorithm for nonlinear prediction using a tree-structured predictor. The code consists of two basic programs/algorithms. The first algorithm estimates the order (size) and parameters of a tree using a growing (splitting) and cross-validation pruning strategy. The second program/algorithm then applies the estimated tree parameters to efficiently compute nonlinear estimates from vector inputs. Browse Software for browsing and searching large image databases efficiently. This is a robust and useful application which runs on win95/98, NT, and unix. It also includes C++ source code, so it can be modified for other applications. MatrixSourceCoding This directory contains software that implements an algorithm for fast space-varying convolution using the matrix source coding technique. Raster Document Test Images A 400 dpi and 600 dpi version of a mixed raster document for use in testing document compression algorithms. Image read and write C-code Easy to use C-subroutines for reading and writing TIFF and JPEG images. Useful Local Information

 Caruthers Group Publications Presentations Posts About Jim Activities Mechanics of Glassy Polymers Single Site Olefin Polymerization Kinetics Professional MS Program: Polymer Science and Engineering for Chemists High School Hardware Store Science Experiments Home Page Home / Home Page Previous Next The Caruthers Group has a diverse set of interests that span both fundamental research and innovative educational methods. Prof. Caruthers believes in the mission of a land grant university to help promote the general welfare of the nation by a balanced portfolio of research and education, where both the research and educational programs need to be innovative and of the highest quality. It order to address this challenge, the Caruthers Group is currently pursuing four major activities. Prediction of expansion gap for PVAc using Stochastic Constitutive Model Mechanics of Glassy Polymers. Prediction of expansion gap for PVAc using Stochastic Constitutive Model. Polymeric materials are among the most important engineering materials is use today, being used in a wide variety of automotive, aerospace, medical, electronic and consumer products. An important class of engineering polymers are glassy polymers, where the glassy state has no long range order like a liquid but it is stiff like a solid. Unlike more traditional materials like metals and ceramics, the mechanical behavior of polymeric glasses is quite sensitive to both temperature and time. A quantitative description of the nonlinear mechanical behavior of glassy polymers remains a considerable technological challenge, where an effective model of the nonlinear, time-dependent response is needed if glassy polymers are to achieve their full potential as engineering materials in 21st century applications. The Caruthers group has developed the state-of-the-art constitutive models to describe the nonlinear, time dependent thermo-mechanical behavior of glassy polymers. Additional Information. The Kinetics of Olefin Polymerization. Polyolefins are the largest volume of Tandem catalytic mechanism for 1-hexene polymerization with a Zirconium bis-phenolate catalyst. polymers that are produced industrially and included polyethylene and polypropylene. The monomer for the polymerization can be either ethylene, propylene or an alpha-olefin like 1-hexene or 1-octene, where a catalyst is typically used to accelerate the polymerization and control the molecular architecture of the resulting polymer. A major advance in polymerization catalysis has been the introduction of single site catalysis vs. traditional Ziegler-Natta catalysis that have multiple catalytic sites. The Caruthers group in collaboration with the research group of Prof. Mahdi Abu-Omar have developed quantitative polymerization models for a variety of single site polymerization catalysts. These models define the state-of-the-art in polymerization modeling, where the models explicitly account for all molecules in the system and use the full complement of experimental data including monomer consumption via 1 H NMR, evolution of the molecular weight distribution via GPC, end group analysis by 2 H NMR and co-monomer composition via 13 C NMR. Series of catalysts with systematic change in molecular architecture have been investigated to begin developing structure-activity relationships the Holy Grail in polymerization catalysis. Additional Information. Motorsport-STEM (M-STEM) Program. Prof. Caruthers is the founding Director of Purdues M-STEM education program. M-STEM is an integrated STEM program that uses the excitement of motorsports to engage young people in STEM education. The program has two components: the evGrandPrix electric go-kart event that is held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway each May as part of the Indy500 festivities and a series of hands-on experiments that can be used in a high school physical science class that connect basic physical science concepts with electric go-kart technology. The evGrandPrixis an education event where student teamsdesign, construct and test electric go-karts and then race the go-karts at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway just prior to Pole Day of the Indy500. The evGrandPrix is much more than a race, where overall scoring is based upon a combination of race placement, energy efficiency, engineering design and community outreach. The event has both a high school and a collegiate division, where student teams from across Indiana, the USA and Europe compete. The high school division engages a wide variety of students, including students that will pursue a BS Engineering/Technology degree or an Associate Degree in a variety of topics like advanced manufacturing, robotic technology, supply chain management or matriculate directly to work with an industry certification, e.g. welding. High School teams are organized like small manufacturing companies that include engineering, technology, manufacturing, project management, advertising/marketing, logisitics, communications and art/design all working together for a common goal. The collegiate division has a similar objective as the high school division, providing students the opportunity to deploy material they learn in the classroom in an exciting environment as part of one of the worlds premier sporting events. The standard electric division of the Collegiate evGrandPrix has been at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway since 2009. In 2018 there will be a new Collegiate Remote Controlled Division, where student will race remote controlled electric go-karts and in 2019 there will also be an autonomous Division these new divisions will allow collegiate student to innovate at the highest level on some of the most exciting technology of the 21st century. Additional information on the evGrandPrix. High School Hardware Store Science Experiments. A key objective of the M-STEM program is to use the evGrandPrix to better engage students in the STEM disciplines.Of particular concern is the fact that themanufacturing industries in the US are in need of a STEM enabled workforce as the baby boom begins to retire in mass. A key challenge is to engage all students in STEM, not just those students that will pursue an engineering or science degree at the university, since basic STEM skills are needed for a variety of career pathways. The technology in the electric go-karts has been deconstructed,where almost all of the topics covered in a high school physical science course can be connected to the go-karts. This provides a real world context of how basic science concepts are connected to actual engineered products. Student first build their experimental apparatus using material found in any hardware store (thus they learn basic making skills that are the foundation for a manufacturing career), then they are taught how to do one experiment and analyze that data and finally they are asked a series of inquiry-based, what-if questions where they can explore using their recently constructed apparatus. The suite of Hardware Store Science Experiments provides a balanced collection of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math experiences that engage students that have a variety of career objectives. Additional Information. Professional MS Program: Polymer Science and Engineering Concentration. Polymers are one of the most important products of the chemical industry; however, many students never have the chance to be introduced to polymers as part of their undergraduate education. This is particularly true of students that graduate with a BS degree in chemistry. Caruthers in collaboration with other Purdue Chemical Engineering faculty is currently offering a polymer concentration as part of its Professional MS Program in Chemical Engineering. The program is designed so that student that come from a chemistry program are qualified to take the program, where there are often significantly enhanced employment opportunities for students with a MS in Chemical Engineering vs a BS in Chemistry. In addition to polymer science and engineering courses the Professional MS students take some basic engineering courses, introduction to business and a summer project course. Additional Information.

From September 2011 to June 2014, I served as a Program Director in the US National Science Foundation managing the Control Systems Program and the National Robotics Initiative (NRI) for the Engineering Directorate. Currently, I am the Assistant Dean for Global Engineering Programs and Partnerships for the College of Engineering . Before joining Purdue University, I worked for HP and was part of the team that developed the HP Copyjet product line in the late 1990s. At Purdue, I teach courses in the systems, measurements and control (SMAC) area and conduct research in mechatronics and dynamical systems and control. In 1999, working with a team of Purdue students and a West Lafayette High School teacher, we founded the Purdue FIRST Programs, which is a student organization that supports and mentors local and Indiana K-12 students through the FIRST Robotics activities. To facilitate and sustain PFPs community service, I offered a hands-on experiential style course for PFP college mentors to develop their mentoring, project and event management, and leadership skills. I served on the Executive Committee of the ASME Dynamic Systems and Control Division and was the Chair of the division from June 2013 to June 2014. I also served as the Editor for the Journal of Imaging Science and Technology from 2012 to June 2014. Currently, I am the Editor-in-Chief for the IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics . I am a Fellow of ASME and a Fellow of the Society for Imaging Science and Technology. Education PhD (1994) University of California at Berkeley MS (1990) University of California at Berkeley BS (1985) National Taiwan University Research Our research centers around mechatronics and dynamic systems and control with applications to digital printing and imaging systems, digital fabrications and functional printing, human motor control, motion and vibration perception and control, and robotics. Our efforts focus on application motivated research, where research problems are formulated from application specific characteristics, constraints and objectives. Novel solutions that meet implementation constraints are developed using integrated systems approaches and appropriate technology translations. Results from our research group have impacted products such as hydraulic lifts, laser and inkjet printers, document scanners and off-road vehicles.
